okay
so
it's not hard
but it's time consuming
the very first thing you need to do is open the game in debug mode, go to nudge, click "database" and generate a new RGB value
do this for however many new provinces you want to add

make sure to write them down

next, open something like GIMP or Photoshop or Paint.net
I use GIMP personally
and then open up your mod's provinces.bmp
set the pencil tool to the specific RGB value you got from the game
and then draw your little island wherever the ass you want on the map
do the same for all the colours/provinces you want
go to file, export, and export it to documents/Paradox Interactive/ HOI4/mod/YOUR MOD/Map/provinces.bmp or something like that
and then save it as a 24 bit BMP file, and DO NOT save colour pallette options

next open up the terrain map and draw the proper terrain in the same spots as you drew the new provinces
you can find a list of terrains on the wiki, and I'm pretty sure it's pinned here

then go into your localisation folder and open the province one
I can't remember it's name off the top of my head
wait shit
nevermind I remember
in your map folder
there's a file called definitions.csv
open that
and add your new provinces
just add 1 to whatever province id is right before it, i.e .13290 -> 13291
and then the next three numbers are the R, G, and B values of your province colour
and then the type of terrain (I believe this is graphical but set it to the same one you painted in terrain)
and then whether or not it has a coast (it's an island, so yes)
and then the continent it's on (it's an island, so the continent is "0")

After that go into history/states
make a new state
and your provinces to it
and buildings, victory points, manpower, etc.
you can copy it from another state or look it up on the wiki
then either add it to an existing supply area or make a new one
this can be done in the nudge tool in game
and then add it to a strategic region, or make a new one
this can also be done in the nudge tool
After all that, go into nudge and just check for errors
in the buildings category, etc.
and use the "units" tab to design how you want units to display on the graphics map when they're in the province
and then I think you're done
